                            <p>This view has been my main focus within the group project.</p>
                            <p>Initially, I had to figure out how canvas works and how to manipulate 
                                it with Javascript. We ended up using parts of a npm library for the main 
                                functions, i.e. drawing a line, a square and an ellipse. 
                                I then had to integrate the canvas functions within React, 
                                which represented a challenge since React is using a virtual DOM 
                                and we were not consistently able to access the canvas object. </p>
                            <p>Each object drawn on the canvas is added to Redux state. 
                                I wrote reducer functions to implement the undo, redo and clear 
                                buttons. </p>
                            <p>Sockets allow multiple users to work on the same whiteboard no matter their location.
                            </p>
                            <p>Drawings are submitted in real time and the undo and redo functions also work across boards.</p>
